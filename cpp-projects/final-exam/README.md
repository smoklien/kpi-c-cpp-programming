# Final Exam

Standart Containers. Lists. Templates. Algorithms. Sorting.

## Task:

1. Create a template class __"Spisok"__ for working with one-way list. Implement getters, constructors, a default constructor that creates an empty list and methods for getting last and first elements. Create print methods.

2. Implement sorting algorithm in a descending order.

3. Write a program that demonstrates a work of the template with list of integers and list of strings.

4. Create two arrays of __Spisok's__ objects. Create an external function for merging lists. Sort the elements by their length in the final merged list in descending order.

5. Handle any types of exceptions.
